# ASL Alphabet Recognition using Random Forest

This project utilizes machine learning to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet signs using the Random Forest classifier. The application uses real-time hand gesture recognition through the webcam, providing immediate feedback on predicted signs.

## Dataset
The ASL Alphabet dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet/code). It contains individual folders for each ASL alphabet letter, including 'A' to 'Z', 'space', 'delete', and 'nothing'.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Pickle (`pickle`)

You can install these libraries using pip:
